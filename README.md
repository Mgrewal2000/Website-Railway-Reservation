This repository contains all the source code files, schemas, deployment scripts for my online railway booking system website.
In this project, I designed and implemented a relational database system to support the operations of an online railway booking system. I used HTML for the user interface, MySQL for the database server, and Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and database server. I used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host my web application as well as my MySQL server.
